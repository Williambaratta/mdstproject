    <br>
    <br>
    Jack Lowden: Hi, I'm Jack Lowden <br>
    Olivia Cook: And I'm Olivia Cook. <br>
    Jack Lowden: And in our new series, Slow Horses, we take you deep into the world of British Espionage. <br>
    Olivia Cook: It's not as slick, or as glamorous as you might think, but it does have a language of its own. <br>   
    Jack Lowden: And we are going to test our skills in deciphering that code.<br>
    Olivia Cook: Are you ready? Because I'm ready. <br>
    Jack Lowden: I am not ready. Word: Bang and Burn. <br>
    Olivia Cook: It when you quickly digest evidence and then burn it so no one sees it? <br>
    Jack Lowden: Chat them up, sleep with them and then get outta there. â€“ Demolition and sabatoge operations. <br>
    Olivia Cook: Oh, of course.<br>
    Jack Lowden: You're kidding, right? Unbelievable. Word: Cobbler. A man that makes shoes? <br>
    Olivia Cook: Shoe cobbler. Cobbling evidence together? <br>
    Jack Lowden: A tailer. A tailor? Someone who tails, and not a tailor of clothes.<br>
    Together: A spy who creates false passports. <br>
    Jack Lowden: The word to decifer is Naked. No alias? Having no alias. <br>
    Olivia Cook: Is the target naked? Is the target in clear view? <br>
    Jack Lowden: Is it an agent that looks good? <br>
    Olivia Cook: Answer: A spy without operating... that's probably the closest we've gotten. <br>
    Olivia Cook: Word: Bird watcher. A Bird Watcher? A spy on the lookout whose... <br>
    Jack Lowden: Someone high up. Surveillance. Someone that works specifically in surveillance. Answer: slang used by British Intelligence for a spy.<br>
    Olivia Cook: Terrible.<br>
    Jack Lowden: Yeah, nailed that.<br>
    Jackson Lamb: Boy, you people are slow.<br>
    Olivia Cook: To find out more about spy words,<br>
    Jack Lowden: and the people crazy enough to do it,<br>
    Olivia Cook: watch "Slow Horses," coming soon to Apple TV+.<br>
