         Voice 1: I made a lot of bad bets with my friends as a kid. Things like can you pick this lock? Can you beat this video game? One of the ones I regret most is, can you solve this Rubik’s cube? The stakes were high, this was when we were really getting into our commodore machines and we bet a box of floppy disks. When I made the bet I thought I could go to the library and really figure out how to solve the cube. But after spending two hours maybe three sitting in the library turning the cube and trying to get it right, I couldn’t figure it out. I put the book down and realized I was going to lose a box of floppy disks. Then a dark thought crossed my mind. Perhaps I wasn’t going to lose a box of floppy disk. Perhaps I could solve the cube with a more unconventional way. I decided I was going to do one of two things: I was going to take my Rubiks cube apart, or I was going to take the stickers off and reapply them. At first glance I thought the sticker thing might be easier then it occurred to me that maybe they would lose their stick ability and I wouldn’t be able to put them back on so I went home. Got a screwdriver and started trying to pry the Rubiks cube apart. Now since then I’ve learned to properly take a Rubiks cube apart. A quarter turn and then you can pop the pieces off. Back then I started to just take the cube jab a screwdriver at the center cue which I thought wasn’t attached to the base, and soon it wouldn’t be. And I pried upward and that centerpiece popped into the air. I had busted my Rubiks cube in an attempt to score some floppy disks. The real weird thing weird thing about this is, I decided not to bring it up to my friends and they didn’t either so the bet itself went nowhere which is often the case with our bets. You take them seriously when something else would happen. But I had a constant reminder in my Rubik’s cube. It would be a few years before before I was able to pick one up at garage sale and I would work on that one failing most of the time till i finally figured it out and now can finally solve the Rubiks cube without breaking it, or removing the stickers.

        I don’t know why I’m so fascinated with the Rubiks cube, but I always have been. Maybe it’s the puzzle, maybe it’s the colors maybe it’s the cartoon that I was obsessed with during its brief run I’m not sure but on today's show we’re going to talk about the cartoon Rubik the amazing cube. We’ll talk about the people behind the camera people, doing the voices, the plot, the shows all too brief run the theme song and where you can find Rubik the amazing cube today. We have an info packed episode ahead of us so without further ado, let’s start the show.

Voice 1: Rubik the amazing cube ran from September 1983 to September 1984 and it was produced by Ruby Spears. It was on TV as part of the Pac-Man Rubik the amazing cube hour on ABC. Ruby Spears, the creators of the show, is a California based production company that specializes in animation. It was founded in 1977 by Joe Ruby and Ken Spears. They have both started out as sound editors at Hanna-Barbera and would eventually start writing stories on shows like the Herculoids and Space Ghost. In the late 60s, they were tasked with developing a cartoon for Saturday morning that was mystery-based. The end result would be the iconic "Scooby Doo Where Are You." Eventually they would depart from Hanna-Barbera and would create the Ruby spears studio."</p>
