    <br>
    <br>
    Jackson Lamb: I need a team of good agents. But I just have the Slow Horses.<br>
    [Intense background music]<br>
    Jackson Lamb: Alright make this quick. I've got underlings to bully. I’m busy.<br>
    Ingrid Tearny: No one in Slough House is busy.<br>
    Jackson Lamb: Come on, get on with it.<br>
    Ingrid Tearny: A team from MI5 has gone rogue… and Standish has been taken.<br>
    River Cartwright: What's the plan?
    [Pants zip]<br>
    Jackson Lamb: I need a team of good agents. But I just have the slow horses. And the traitors we’re looking for are ex-military. <br>
    Sean Donovan: There will be a reckoning.<br>
    Military Personel: Go! Go!<br>
    Ingrid Tearny: You can wipe your slate clean.<br>
    River Cartwright: Okay.<br>
    River Cartwright: There's another game being played that will probably leave me worse off. I just can't see what this one is yet.<br>
    [Car alarm chirps] <br>
    Roddy Ho: It is an honor to be selected for field work.<br>
    Jackson Lamb: Shut up.<br>
    Roddy Ho: Got it.<br>
    [Car stutters to a start]<br>
    Jackson Lamb: Really?<br>
    Jackson Lamb: Check the CCTV. I'd be amazed if you hadn't missed something.<br>
    Diana Taverner: I still have oversight of the slow horses.<br>
    [Guns clicking]<br>
    [Car alarm chirps]<br>
    Diana Taverner: Lucky me.<br>
    [Intense background music]<br>
    River Cartwright: There are men outside with guns. Some backup might be handy.<br>
    Jackson Lamb: Well, I'm busy.<br>
    River Cartwright: Okay. Thanks<br>
    River Cartwright: I'm sure the situation will resolve itself.<br>
    [Intense background music]<br>
    Sean Donovan: MI5 betrayed us. Justice is coming their way.<br>
    [Intense background music]<br>
    Ingrid Tearny: We have to limit the collateral damage.<br>
    Nick Duffy: Everyone in that facility is coming out in a body bag.<br>
    Shirley Dander: You're smiling?<br>
    Macrus Longridge: Yeah. I feel alive, don't you?<br>
   [Gunshots]<br>
    River Cartwright: What would you have done?<br>
    Jackson Lamb: I would have killed every one of them.<br>
    Jackson Lamb: If they threatened to kill you on the other hand I’d buy 'em a beer and the bullets.<br>
    [car door slams]<br>
    [sighs]<br>
    Jackson Lamb: Go on, out you get.<br>
    [sighs]  <br>

    <br>
    Jack Lowden: Hi, I'm Jack Lowden <br>
    Olivia Cook: And I'm Olivia Cook. <br>
    Jack Lowden: And in our new series, Slow Horses, we take you deep into the world of British Espionage. <br>
    Olivia Cook: It's not as slick, or as glamorous as you might think, but it does have a language of its own. <br>   
    Jack Lowden: And we are going to test our skills in deciphering that code.<br>
    Olivia Cook: Are you ready? Because I'm ready. <br>
    Jack Lowden: I am not ready. Word: Bang and Burn. <br>
    Olivia Cook: It when you quickly digest evidence and then burn it so no one sees it? <br>
    Jack Lowden: Chat them up, sleep with them and then get outta there. Answer: Demolition and sabatoge operations. <br>
    Olivia Cook: Oh, of course.<br>
    Jack Lowden: You're kidding, right? Unbelievable. Word: Cobbler. A man that makes shoes? <br>
    Olivia Cook: Shoe cobbler. Cobbling evidence together? <br>
    Jack Lowden: Word: tailer. A tailor? Someone who tails, and not a tailor of clothes.<br>
    Together: Answer: A spy who creates false passports. <br>
    Jack Lowden: The word to decifer is Naked. No alias? Having no alias. <br>
    Olivia Cook: Is the target naked? Is the target in clear view? <br>
    Jack Lowden: Is it an agent that looks good? <br>
    Olivia Cook: Answer: A spy without operating... that's probably the closest we've gotten. <br>
    Olivia Cook: Word: Bird watcher. A Bird Watcher? A spy on the lookout whose... <br>
    Jack Lowden: Someone high up. Surveillance. Someone that works specifically in surveillance. Answer: slang used by British Intelligence for a spy.<br>
    Olivia Cook: Terrible.<br>
    Jack Lowden: Yeah, nailed that.<br>
    Jackson Lamb: Boy, you people are slow.<br>
    Olivia Cook: To find out more about spy words,<br>
    Jack Lowden: and the people crazy enough to do it,<br>
    Olivia Cook: watch "Slow Horses," coming soon to Apple TV+.<br>
